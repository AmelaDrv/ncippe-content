# PPE Content

This repo contains the content used by the [NCIPPE Front End](https://github.com/CBIIT/ncippe-front-end)

NCIPPE Front End implements [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) for multilingual support

## Edit content

This project was built to support [Babel Edit](https://www.codeandweb.com/babeledit) as the translation manager of choice. To edit content files you should first clone this repository. The next step is to open the `locales` folder in Babel Edit and make the necessary content changes. When changes are complete and saved, push your changes up to GitHub. Finally, create a pull request to have your changes reviewed and committed to the master branch where they will be queued for the next release.
